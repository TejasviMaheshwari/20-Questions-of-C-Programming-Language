# C Programming Fundamentals: Logic, Arrays & Matrices

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of 20 C programs focused on fundamental logic, mathematical operations, and data structures. These implementations demonstrate core programming concepts ranging from basic control flow to advanced matrix multiplication and sorting algorithms.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Concepts

* **Decision Making:** Extensive use of `else if` ladders for complex conditional logic.


* **Iterative Logic:** Utilization of `while` and `for` loops for number theory problems including Prime, Armstrong, and Palindrome checks.

* **Data Structures:** 1D array manipulation including searching, insertion, and sorting algorithms.


* **Linear Algebra:** 2D array handling, matrix summation, and multiplication with dimension validation.


* **String Manipulation:** Pattern generation and substring handling.
